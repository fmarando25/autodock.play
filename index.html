            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>AutoDock uses conductive aluminum plates and smart relays to automatically connect power to your ride-on vehicle. When your car docks into place, the plates align and power is delivered safely to recharge the battery—without needing to plug anything in.</p>

            <h2>About the Creator</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Francesco. I'm an automation engineer and a dad. This project started when I wanted a safe, simple way for my son to charge his ride-on car without unplugging or dealing with wires. After years of working in robotics and electrical design, I decided to build something that could help other families and businesses too — and AutoDock was born.</p>
